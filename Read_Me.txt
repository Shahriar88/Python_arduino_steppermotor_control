1. Upload the 0.0StandardFirmata.ino file to arduino
2. Run the motor_05.py file
3. Press initialize Arduino Button
4. Slide Enable option
5. Slide Direction option to change the direction of rotation
6. You can use box, radio button or slider to set the data
7. This program is can be developed more. Now the python controls every input/output
of the arduino directly. It is better to change in a way that Arduino receive the turn and loop data
and creates the pull signal by itself.
For that there needs to be some changes in  Arduino and python code. Have plan to do that.
Due to heavy work load at graduate study, yet could not manage time for that.
